It felt as if you walked in a fairytale. It also has a splendid patio.\n\nThe waiters are very polite and nice, but they should work on punctuality. We arrived at 9:00 p.m., one waiter gave us the menus, we decided, and only after 25 minutes another waiter took our order.

It‚Äôs tucked away, so you might miss it if you‚Äôre not specifically looking for it. The place has a cozy terrace and an intimate indoor area with around 10-12 tables, creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere.\n\nOur experience was impeccable from the start: we arrived late, around 9:00 pm (Spanish time), without a reservation, and were still greeted warmly. The staff was exceptional. Before seating us, they showed us the menu and carefully explained the dishes to make sure everything was to our liking‚Äîa thoughtful touch that made us feel at home.\n\nWhen we asked for Romanian wine, they recommended a dry white off-menu option, which was perfect. The wine had a flavor profile very similar to albari√±o, ideal for Spanish tastes. Dinner started with a complimentary appetizer and a basket of homemade focaccia, which was delicious‚Äîsoft and full of flavor from the first bite. We then shared several dishes: an eggplant toast, burrata salad, and a seafood rice with fish and prawns. Everything was exquisitely prepared, with portions just the right size‚Äînot too large, not too small. For dessert, we tried their tiramisu, which was also delightful.\n\nThe ambiance was another highlight. The background music was tasteful and elegant, creating a refined atmosphere that allowed for easy conversation‚Äîquite a change from the louder, club-style music common in other Romanian venues.\n\nWe will definitely return. This is one of the top spots in Romania for enjoying good food, quality wine, and a lively conversation in a beautifully curated setting. The price is around 50 euros per person, taking into account that wine in Romania is quite pricey, with bottles ranging between 35 and 40 euros.",

But I am grateful I discovered it! I stopped order Chinese food from other places since then, because I found the perfect flavour with Shenyang!\n\nYou can find this restaurant on both Glovo and Tazz apps, but you have to make sure that they deliver in your area first. I ordered food for one of my friends who lives in Manastur, Ion Mester area, and I discovered they don‚Äôt deliver there. But it is manageable, because you can wait for the food in other areas of Cluj and gather together with your friends after you receive it.\n\nI ate form Shenyang the next dishes:\n- Ma la fen - it is very spicy. For people who never eat spicy, it is very spicy! So be careful, but it could be very tasty for spicy fans.\n- TƒÉie»õei de orez cu legume (»ôi uneori cu pui) - Rice noodles with vegetables (and sometimes with chicken) - my favourite dish with both chicken or just vegetables! In my opinion, the chicken flavour does not make any difference, so I started eating them just with vegetables and they are still delicious!\n- LƒÉstari de porumb cu orez (»ôi uneori cu pui) - Corn with rice (and sometimes with chicken) - in this dish, the chicken feels better than in the case of rice noodles. The dish is a great choice without meet as well and the sauce is something unique!\n- Pache»õele de primƒÉvarƒÉ cu legume - Spring rolls with vegetables - the best ones! They are big, well-fried and price friendly.\n- Jiao zi cu carne de vitƒÉ - Jiao zi (similar to dumplings) with beef meet - very tasty! The dough was a bit too thick for me, but they are a lot and you can eat from this dish other days, too, combining it with a side dish.\n- Jiao zi cu ciuperci - Jiao zi with mushrooms - better than the beef one, in my opinion.\n\nI recommend to you to always buy soy sauce and to add to the dishes, because they don‚Äôt have that much sauce and it gives them a great flavour!\n\nIn addition, you can both order and eat there. The restaurant is located on Clo»ôca street, namely in the corner between Clo»ôca and Horea. The place is small inside and it has a semi-opened kitchen. If you prefer delivery, the dishes are very big, price friendly (each dish is no more than 5 euros, 25 RON), and they always arrived to my place almost hot, which is a great plus! But you have to know that you wait around 45 minutes to receive the order, especially in the evening. For 2 persons, it is enough to order 2 dishes and some spring rolls. It is still a lot of food to share.\n\nI leave some photos here and I hope everybody enjoys this place! :)",

In fact, after 7 months spent in Barcelona where I've had sea food everyday, I'll have to say their king prawns with tabbouleh salad were absolutely delicious.\n\nThey have a nice garden and the interior of the restaurant has a bit of a posh British pub energy.

The sausages, chicken breast, and pulled pork were enjoyable, though I believe the sausages were cold-smoked, which isn‚Äôt what I typically expect from BBQ. The ribs had a great smoky flavor, although they were slightly burnt. Overall, I enjoyed the meal, but there‚Äôs room for improvement.

Please, Papabox, correct me if I'm wrong. But the dough has a pricked pattern on the bottom, and the consistency is that of a dense sponge. We have also done it at home. As far as I know real pizza dough doesn't stiffen before being put in the oven and being very soft it wouldn't even keep those shapes.\n\nI also ordered a schnitzel menu which turned out not to be actually schnitzel, but a pre-frozen preparation made of meat paste, not chicken breast... This was personally confirmed by them. So, I used to walk 1 minute to Kaufland and buy my \"snitel\" at 20% of the price they sell it for.\n\nPlease understand: when you order from a restaurant you expect cooked food. Not food bought from the supermarket already semi-cooked, and delivered, at restaurant prices. I expect a professional restaurant to cook more special than what I can do alone at home. You pissed me off.\n\nI haven't been so disappointed by a \"restaurant\" in years.",

The hotel agreed to a rate through the booking.com platform with no prepayment, but when they realised that it was booked for a major local event, they called to change the rate to almost 3 times the original rate AND request a prepayment.

There is nothing more off-putting than expecting a warm, fresh meal only to receive something that feels like it‚Äôs been sitting out for too long. Beyond just being cold, the flavors were bland and unappealing, making it hard to enjoy any aspect of the meal.\n\nFor the high prices they charge, I expected much better quality. Unfortunately, what I got was nowhere near worth the cost. It felt like I was overpaying for something that didn‚Äôt even meet the basic standards of flavor or freshness. The ingredients didn‚Äôt seem fresh, and the overall presentation of the dishes was poor.\n\nIt‚Äôs frustrating to spend money on food that doesn‚Äôt meet even the simplest expectations, especially when there are many other options available at more reasonable prices and better quality. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place if you‚Äôre looking for a satisfying meal. The combination of high prices, low quality, and poor taste makes it an experience I wouldn‚Äôt want to repeat. I‚Äôd advise looking elsewhere if you want good food at a fair price.",

Long story now: cashier was nice, she was smiling and asked me for the entire order recommending that the guys will help me with the salads and sauces as needed. The guy preparing my Gyro was Alex. When asked for Tzatziki he said that doesn't come with the sandwich but whatever. At that point his colleague, Dorin, mentioned that if it doesn't he shouldn't put it on, in a rude manner. I thought whatever, but then I followed closely how they prepare my Gyro just because seeing they don't have the \"help the customer\" attitude, I should double check I get everything as ordered. I noticed how the filled up the sandwiches with potatoes, then added a bit of meat and for the salad , one leaf and 3 slices of tomatoes. What you are paying, is pretty much bread and potatoes. My recommendation is to get a portion of potatoes instead rather then throwing you money away.  All in all, poor customer service, food is mediocre, prices are high. There are so many better options , I don't see why would encourage their business.\nAttaches is the photo with the as advertised and what you really get.",

The cosmetics aisle looks really nice.\n\nI think the they are understaffed, just like most of the Profi stores I visited.

It's a shame, they have such good cakes.\n\n---\n\nCakes, cookies, patisserie, ice cream, refreshments. All made in the firm's own little manufacture (elsewhere in town). To savour there or for takeaway. Prices are OK, quality is better than in other shops. Clean. Friendly and helpful staff. Cakes can be ordered from a catalog and customized. Payment with cash/cards.
