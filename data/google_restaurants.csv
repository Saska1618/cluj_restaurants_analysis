Caf√© Bulgakov,"Strada Inocen»õiu Micu Klein 17, Cluj-Napoca",4.6,ChIJxUdgmYIOSUcRDLA-KKOYGRY,"Robert Simoiu: I've been here several times and the food was always good. The garden is really nice, I recommend making a reservation if you plan to eat at a busy time.
They have various food, from Romanian local dishes to normal international ones.
The burger and the sauce were good, along with the soup. Polenta (mƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ) was decent, it could've been better, it didn't had anything special.; Mishal Almudhaf: Outstanding food.! The salad was a simple cucumber, tomatoes, onions, and cabbage. Nothing extraordinary. However, my Moma‚Äôs Chicken was exceptional. Very flavorful strong Gorgonzola cheese flavor played a major role in the dish.

The prices are very good here, and not as expensive as the other restaurants I‚Äôve been to!

Highly Recommend!; Fotograf_Swe (Mr.Sever Clear): Very satisfied with this restaurant. Food is delicious.
I've eat here with whole family.
New update 2024 come back for Christmas. Good food as always .üòç; Jamal Yo: Really great food. And traditional Romanian food as well. You can try tripe soup or cabbage soup etc. Also the best is great and to our satisfaction the waiter was speaking fluently in English. He was also helpful and kind. Big 5 from me; Miruna-Ioana Vasiu: The food has been so great, delicious, and nourishing that I forgot to take a picture of it, my bad. But I'll tell you what we tried:
- 2 Bulgakov Burgers, it has a side dish of French fries and sauce included, and the meat is Pljeskavica
- 1 dense and dark hot chocolate
- 1 simple lemonade
- Papana»ôi with chocolate (although in the menu they appear as Papana»ôi with blueberry jam and sour cream, you may order them with Fineti/ chocolate, and they'll serve it as your ordered)

The venue is spectacular. It felt as if you walked in a fairytale. It also has a splendid patio.

The waiters are very polite and nice, but they should work on punctuality. We arrived at 9:00 p.m., one waiter gave us the menus, we decided, and only after 25 minutes another waiter took our order. The food and drinks arrived pretty quickly, but the initial waiting has been annoying. Anyway, all in all, it's a 5-star restaurant.",0.44

Staff is almost military organized which was fun to watch. The chicken provencal was great and we lo ed the starters. All in all a really good place to go especially when you compare it to some other romanian gourmand experiences; Ivaylo Marinov: Nice experience!
Interesting restaurant.
We were in the first room just after main entrance.
Cozy place, relaxing atmosphere.
Service was very good.
Food was definitely tasty and well presented.
Reasonable prices.
Maybe just the salmon fillet was not according to my taste and I did not really liked it but all the rest was great.
However, we enjoyed our visit and I would definitely visit the place again if I have the chance.; Ana Maria: Amazing dine in experience! Everything was great, food was amazing from starter to desert. We asked for recommendation for wine and it didn t disappoint! Highly recommend this restaurant!!!; Nhung ƒêo√†n: The food was delicious. I ordered duck breast and it was cooked to perfection with slightly crispy skin and moist inside. The lemonade is also tasty and refreshing.; Ana Maria: We had an excellent dinning experience!

La Cina Restaurant,"Strada Constantin Dobrogeanu Gherea 25, Cluj-Napoca",4.2,ChIJ5xoVbyEMSUcR2ubanN4TxOE,"Angi Cristina: Very good food but but no AC and low serving. We heard the same 10 songs over and over again and we wanted to run away because not having AC on 35 degrees is....exhausting.; Matt Margaras: Stopped for a quick Lunch
Only few items from the menu available.
Servi generally speaking was ok, the man in charge to serve us was trying to promote only one thing from the menu, because other n/a; Andrei Verestiuc: For me, I think it's the best place in town to eat the menu of the day.
The place looks ok, serving is ok, but the food taste is simply perfect.; Tudor Moldovan: Unfortunately it was not so good! The food was mediocre, the atmosphere and the ambiance were not up to the standard and the prices were kind of high for what we got. Not going to recommend the place, you should avoid it!; Spiridon Alexandru: The food was ok, but the waiter attitude was lacking.

I went there with my girlfriend today and ordered a menu for me, as she didn't want to eat anything. She decided to buy an apple juice that was 8 RON in the menu, but after we received the apple juice, we saw that the daily menu apple juice was 5 RON, so we asked the waiter if we could add it to the already ordered menu.

We received a strong 'NO' and when asked why, he said he's gonna ask. Well, he didn't, didn't say anything and on the check the apple juice was 8 RON.

I can understand if the serving sizes differ in the daily menu versus the normal menu, but there was no need for such an attitude. A simple friendly explanation would have been sufficient.

Overall, would not recommend.",0.7
The Doner Place,"City Center, Strada Gheorghe »òincai 7, Cluj-Napoca",4,ChIJH2J224IOSUcRJRg5zBSfslg,"Ebrahem Droobi: Tasty doner!!

The girls were very proficient. They speak English.

Dine in is available.
They offer takeout and over the phone orders.
Bathroom is available.

Prices are very reasonable.

Parking is by the side of the street. In case no parking spot by the restaurant then you have to walk a little bit.

Cheers; Adrian Bilc: The new location looks good and they have the same team as they had in the old place. It might be that they don't have a lot of customers in this period and therefore quality of the food is not great. From my point of food, even though it's a fast-food, the taste is not as good as it used to be. Hopefully they will solve this and they will have a 5 star.; Georgios: Ordered and paid with a card for delivery, after a really long wait I got a phone call from the delivery guy (I will analyze below more details) and he was insisting for me to go downstairs, outside to get the food. I explained that it was not possible and he told me that he will leave with a very bad manner, tone of voice and language. I talked with the delivery app and told them the situation and that I decided not to get the food after the way I was treated. Later on another delivery guy came, and called us the second delivery guy was very calm and cooperative to discuss but we already cancelled the order now through the app. He explained that the previous delivery guy was not a delivery guy, but the Doner Place payed a taxi driver to come and bring the food. A taxi driver that is not verified and not qualified through any hygienic means to touch the food that I will put in my mouth. A very unprofessional way from the Doner Place, as it shows how much attention they give for hygiene; Mark Chandler: Very friendly and accommodating staff. My wife was in hospital in Cluj, and they let me stay there all day to wait. It is clean , the food is great, and the portions are large. Come with an appetite. I would not eat anywhere else. I loved it there.; Vlad Costea: Think twice if you want to order food through delivery. First of all, they handle the delivery themselves even if you order with Glovo. There are no updates about the delivery, no status, nothing. We had to wait 2 hours for 2 plates when, initially, they gave out an estimate up to 70 minutes, which is still massive.

On the other side someone ordered a burger and looked like a toast sandwich :)) so It‚Äôs a no no; Adrian Z: The place has a really nice atmosphere and a very friendly staff. The terrace is quite cozy, especially if you don't like the tables placed outside, common everywhere else in the area.
Regarding the location, anything they could do to signal where it's placed better would be a big up. But due to the local laws, and restrictions on advertising in the historical center, that blame is not theirs.
It's definitely a place good for hanging out with friends, especially now during the pandemic.; Maximilian Both: I love this place. Good music, excellent food although the portions are really small. Not too many alcohol sortiments, hence the 4 star rating. Service is good and the place is perfect for a nice evening. Sometimes they have small live concerts which is a bonus.; Horatiu Popescu: Nice and enjoyable pub with pretty decent food, good services and fairly good prices. Usual music playing is older rock which makes it enjoyable and not that common. They also organise events like trivia nights. Since it is usually a crowded place reservations are recommended.; Rasta Man: It's a pretty decent place, good food, good wine and cocktails. The terase has a nice vibe and it's simple in a good way.

Divino Porcello,"Strada D√°vid Ferenc 13, Cluj-Napoca",4.5,ChIJhb27250OSUcRcz_8fgHZ2xc,"Bogdan Hurtupan: Great atmosphere, but details makes Divino Porcello a standard restaurant rather than a high-end one. We went in to have early dinner (around 6PM) and it was us + 2 tables. The service was ok until around 7:30PM, when other people came in and the waiter completely forgot about us. It is true he was alone though and it's not his fault. Food portions are relatively small, that's probably why prices are cheaper.; Robert: This place is a real gem! It's conveniently located close to the heart of the city but far enough to escape the noise and bustle.
We felt very well welcomed from the beginning, our waiter was not only friendly and attentive but also conducted himself with the utmost professionalism.
The food and drinks were delicious and the ambiance of the venue contributed to an overall pleasant experience.; Dan Manastireanu: Great food and a very nice atmosphere with Spanish guitar music. Friendly and responsive staff.
We enjoyed it and will come again to try more of the dishes.

We had the tartare and eggplant dipper as starters. Both were good, the tartare was one of our favorite in Cluj.

For the main course, we had Salmon and shrimps, and the Iberico special. Both are very tasty, with interesting flavors. Would recommend both.; Sara Fekete: Everything was divine.

Shanghai Express,"Strada Memorandumului 4, Cluj-Napoca",4.3,ChIJV-x-Ip0OSUcRZW6dKFyHFZU,"Victor-Florin Simon: Tasty food. To hot inside during summer days. There are two women serving, one every other day. One of them is really cheap and adds just o bit of chicken and sauce with rice and the other one adds o whole lot more. Overall it's a good place to eat. The picture below shows how you want a meal here to look like. The A/C isn't always on, I suspect the same person that offers less food to be culprit :). Overall I recommend it.; Carlotta Zocco: Not very good and expensive compared to the quality of food; Vendel-Szilam√©r ‚ÄúSisko‚Äù Varr√≥: This franchise has the best value for money among asian restaurants in town.

Good food, the persons are nice.; Andrea Szekely: Excellent food and they always have good deals if you choose your time right. Small place indeed, good if you are in a hurry or you can just have it as a take away.",0.28
Bistro 1568,"Bulevardul 21 Decembrie 1989 14, Cluj-Napoca",4.4,ChIJjzXKiJ0OSUcR1YnC7nqLkMI,"Marius Mucenicu: The restaurant offers a calm and relaxing atmosphere, but the closely packed tables significantly detract from the experience. Sitting at arm‚Äôs length from the next table means conversations lack privacy, which can make the setting uncomfortable and awkward.

The food is average‚Äîneither impressive nor disappointing‚Äîwith nice plating being the highlight.

The service is inconsistent. One staff member was friendly and welcoming, creating a pleasant interaction, while another appeared disengaged and cold, which made asking for anything feel uninviting.

Overall, it‚Äôs an okay spot, but the lack of intimacy and inconsistent service weigh it down.; Muhamed Mesic: Cuisine inspired by Transylvania, local traditions and ingredients. Friendly service, fast despite the relatively large crowds. Suitable for single diners. Several vegetarian options on the menu, and great selection of drinks including local spirits.; Daniel Oanta: Nice place with a cozy atmosphere, prompt service and good food.; Liviu-Stefanita Baiu: A pleasant early dinner.
The food is great, and the dessert even better.
The service was really nice and the wine  recommendation matched the product quality.

Duck with cabbage and dumplings
Beef stew with (a different kind of) dumplings :)
The dessert ... image speaks for itself, and the are hidden surprises; Dan Huma: Think twice before ordering something else besides the main course, the portions are quite big (but this does NOT come at the price of quality).
They put a lot of work in design and in creating a pleasant atmosphere, and everything seems to be in synergy (from music, to furniture, accessoires etc).",0.09
Olivo Bistro,"Bulevardul Eroilor 7, Cluj-Napoca",4.7,ChIJxeo_kCcMSUcRjOAJ3W7T5Ug,"David Stroe: Olivo remains one of the most popular dining destinations in town, consistently delivering high-quality food and service.

The menu is always innovative and exciting, with dishes that are visually appealing and expertly balanced in flavor and texture and with high-quality ingredients.

Their specialty coffee and matcha are exceptional, among the best I've had in a regular restaurant.

While the staff can sometimes appear tired or overwhelmed, they always provide excellent service. And while we primarily visit for breakfast, Olivo is also an excellent choice for dinner.; Mark Dalton: What a brilliant meal! Best of our trip so far (and we‚Äôve had some great food here in Romania. Great service, friendly and helpful.; June CL: Really cute place. I really enjoyed my shrimps, it is really tender and sauce is delicious. First sight I thought the portion is small, but it really wasn‚Äôt! Bread is also special and delicious.; Olivia M: Had a great brunch here. The uovo in purgatorio (poached eggs in spicy tomato sauce) was really good with a nice spice. The poached eggs with avocado and crispy guanciale was good too although could have had a bit more guanciale. Service was good and overall a nice and tasty experience!; Mirela Haida: Olivo Bistro Caf√©: My Go-To Spot in Cluj Since 2012

I've been coming to Olivo Bistro Caf√© since 2012, and it‚Äôs hands down my favorite place in Cluj. From the moment you step in, the cozy, warm ambiance makes you feel right at home. Whether you're here for a cup of their amazing coffee or a full meal, everything feels thoughtfully crafted and full of flavor.

The food is always exceptional ‚Äî fresh, local ingredients turned into creative, comforting dishes. Their coffee? Easily some of the best in town. But what really sets Olivo apart is the consistency. The staff are always friendly and attentive, making each visit feel special, whether it‚Äôs a quick stop or a lingering dinner.

Olivo has been my go-to for over a decade, and it never disappoints. It‚Äôs a place that just feels right, every time.",0.09

Just wonderful and the mushroom soup was delicious; L. Filip: I really love the concept of cream soup + focaccia/pizza :). Also great prices and service.

The ambiance could be slightly improved, but luckily you can also enjoy it at home via Bolt Food.; Marquito el chocolatero: Loved the soups!
Perfect for a quick lunch break.
Some space for improvement with decoration. They need better towels, wider cups, disposable plates for pizza and a recycle bin.; Gajdo Alexandru: One of the best and breakfast-lunch restaurants in the city, being also the cheapest you can find.

They have great prices for a soup, salads, pasta and pizzone (a thicker pizza-slice sandwhich hybrid), the cheapest can be 3$ and the most expensive is 5$, being able to combine the foods with a soup for prices max to 9$, having a cheap and nutritious meal with quality ingredients and no compromises. They also include with their soups a free fresh foccacia slice, a great option on top of the amazing features this soup bar has.
Everything is freshly made, changing daily the soup recipes, the place's main star.

I had today, as i have been here multiple times, a cheese baked pepper soup with a foccacia and it was amazing, everything was tasty, rightly textured, the soup was hot and savoury and the foccacia was aromatic as it is classically done.

If you wish a quick, nutritive meal in the City of Cluj-Napoca, you must come here ASAP!

The food was standard, and good. There was a soda fountain. They told us we can only have three refills for our cup. When we filled our cup for 7up, it was sparkling water instead.; Ligiu Uiorean: Staff would not provide reasonable quantities for the ingredients, as requested. They explained that the have to follow the recipe. Menu with quantities is not displayed in the store (as probably required by law) and staff took time to produce it.

Anyway I can just recommend this restaurant for anyone in this area! The staff was also caring and speaking English.; Sani Ario: This place wins hands down in terms of street side lively vibe and atmosphere of the square. However, the food was quite average. My octopus was delicious enough, but the frito misto was laden with frozen fish and cheap cuts of vegetables. It would make the nonnas of Italy roll in their grave. Disgraceful. Sit down and have a drink, but be cautious in selecting the dishes.; John F: Excellent food and service! We appreciated the wine recommendation :); sabina todica: Unfortunately not the best experience.
The atmosphere is great due to the location‚Ä¶cathedral, scenery, summer.
Service disappointing- towards the end of our meal all the staff and I mean all the staff were inside sitting and dancing perhaps doing a Tik Tok. Took about 10 min to acknowledge us even though the outside tables were all full, this was around 8 pm
Food was great until the dessert arrived - a very old Tarte Tatin that was meant to have apples on top , was actually green and bitter and look like it‚Äôs days were long gone. I worked for years in the hospitality industry and I would never served that tarte as a Chef or waiter.
Was taken of the bill so fair point at least I wasn‚Äôt asked to pay for it.
I would suggest a customer service training to the serving assistants.
No non alcoholic beer, sparkling wine/prosecco nor decaffeinated coffee available.; Ioana-Livia Murariu: The food is nothing special, the coffee was a bit too acidic.

Had the opportunity to visit Cluj again, so of course, we chose to eat here. This time we were not that impressed. We even brought a couple friends with, and raved about this place the whole way there. Unfortunately,  it was a let down, and none of us really enjoyed their food. The service was good, but the food was really lacking.

I ordered the salmon pasta and there was barely any salmon in it. It was just noodles with 2 tiny pieces of meat.

Even the hummus appetizer was not that tasty anymore. Not sure what happened, but unfortunately,  we won't be coming back.

P.S. my original review is below.

I love this place! Been here a couple times and the food is so delicious and the place feels cozy and really comfortable. I really reccomend the hummus it's the best I've ever had.; Daniel Cox: An EXCELLENT casual restaurant with lovely outdoor views of St Michael's Church.

One minor point: the tables are quite close together, which made it a bit challenging to have a private conversation. It would be even better with just a little more space between tables.

Also, due to the same reason, smoking is allowed and my clothes become smelly :(; Ramona Bugnar: Went there for breakfast. What a cute and eclectic little restaurant, actually, an interior terrace. My eggs Benedict were really good, as was the cappuccino; Cassie Ellis: Wow! We really pissed off our waitress simply by ordering. We waited at the table for 15 minutes and eventually had to flag down a waitress to order. She was very annoyed that we selected her and she was very curt with us (not a language/cultural barrier - my husband is Romanian). She behaved the same way when we asked her for the check. I hope she is able to find work in another industry - she is not suited to working in any field where she needs to interact with other people.

The food and atmosphere was great! I do recommend a visit - just be mindful who you order from.; Aureliana Soldan: Place is really cool, I absolutely loved it, especially the inside terrace. The only thing regarding the food,which is also the reason why I gave 4 stars, is the fact that the pork knuckle was cold inside (it was probably cooked previously and heated on the spot, but ours was not sufficiently heated so the meat on the interior was still cold) and the cannoli is supposed to be crunchy, not soft and soaked. The cream inside was tasty, though. On the other hand, the risotto and all the food actually was very tasty. all in all, the place  is really cool and I loved it.

This restaurant is undoubtedly one of the best I‚Äôve tried in Romania. It‚Äôs tucked away, so you might miss it if you‚Äôre not specifically looking for it. The place has a cozy terrace and an intimate indoor area with around 10-12 tables, creating a warm, welcoming atmosphere.

Our experience was impeccable from the start: we arrived late, around 9:00 pm (Spanish time), without a reservation, and were still greeted warmly. The staff was exceptional. Before seating us, they showed us the menu and carefully explained the dishes to make sure everything was to our liking‚Äîa thoughtful touch that made us feel at home.

When we asked for Romanian wine, they recommended a dry white off-menu option, which was perfect. The wine had a flavor profile very similar to albari√±o, ideal for Spanish tastes.

Prices were normal/low. The music was loud and it did fit the place's style.; Marius Mirea: Heard that this place serves Indian food so I decided to give it a try. Ordered chicken jalfrezi but got some form of stew which has nothing to do with Indian food. The place is really messy, they play lots of Latino music and manele. The majority of the clients are gipsies. I don't recomand it if you want Indian food, just stick with indigo and gandhi.; Ciprian Sanfira: Nice place with cheap hookah, but you need to pay for extra coal and when i was there they said that it's closes at 10 pm.

Food is basic, nothing extraordinary.
Kind waiters. They served quiet fast.
Tried some beers and a cocktail.; Bianca Iota: Best goulash in town. Besides that, the food is good, nothing out of the ordinary. The only downside was that the server was busy kissing another server and forgot one of our orders.; C T: Great night. The meat selections are superb and go perfectly with a choice of local beers. A must try. Can get a little noisy as it‚Äôs a big place with lots of happy people!; M B: Great atmosphere and food, definitely recommend.

As drinks we had their crafted beer -forgot the name, but it‚Äôs the red one with ginger, amazing as well.; Ionut Raducanu: The place has an open terrace on the 4th floor and it is a great place to enjoy a meal or a drink. The drinks here were homemade and quite tasty. However, the food was lacking in some departments. The ribs I ordered were a bit overcooked, the chicken sandwich had some vegetables in the patty, and the taste was not recognisable as chicken, and the waiting time for the food to arrive was over 30 minutes.

Definitely a spot worth checking out!; Sebastian Canta: Good food, even if a little on the pricey side. Would recommend the burgers; Maarten: I ate here because of a recommendation. I went for the beef soup with sour cream and the beef rib.
The soup was nothing special but nevertheless a good starter and not that expensive.
The rib with very tasty but contained way too much fat for my liking, of course this is something to be expected of a beef (short) rib but there was not enough other food to really counteract the fat.
I might return and try out a steak instead, I was told that that's the dish I should've ordered by the one recommending the place.
Apart from the amount of fat the rib was really tasty, because of that a 4 start review.; Rusu Alex: I planned my visit at Muura Steakhouse in advance, I always saw it when passing through Museum Square and I said to myself I ll eat here one day. Last night the plann was applied and I cam and asked for the greatest steak they had. Central location, made reservations just to be sure we get that table. The place was full, all tables booked full of people, the waiters had some issues delivering the food because of the crowd. The steak was great tho, I enjoyed every piece of it especially that it was comming after a great workout. They also have some very good violet tea and cheesecake and great some delicious turkey breast my date tried and was happy with.

The place has an amazing atmosphere for any occasion. It's elegant yet cozy, perfect for everything from a casual dinner to a special celebration. The decor is beautiful, creating a warm and inviting vibe that makes every visit special.

Highly recommended! :); Robert Simoiu: The atmosphere was great, portions are quite big, but I expected something more for the higher price tag. The dessert was homemade, which should be healthier, and I appreciate it (even if it wasn't something very special).
Carbonara was good, with the original recipe (pecorino and guanciale) , and the mussles were also great, but some of them were empty.
We reserved a table in the garden, but there were no places there when we arrived, so we stayed in front of the restaurant, which was also ok.

The atmosphere is nice, a very nice design, the waiters are very friendly, the customers seem nice people.

I discovered Shenyang in March this year, although I work at the Faculty of Letters. But I am grateful I discovered it! I stopped order Chinese food from other places since then, because I found the perfect flavour with Shenyang!

You can find this restaurant on both Glovo and Tazz apps, but you have to make sure that they deliver in your area first. I ordered food for one of my friends who lives in Manastur, Ion Mester area, and I discovered they don‚Äôt deliver there.

I ordered a chicken bamboo with rice and some sort of dumplings with pork. The chicken bamboo and rice was ok, it would‚Äôve been nice if it had more taste. The dumplings were very good but I ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù them with the available sauces sitting on a table. I did not like the fact that the place itself was not managed properly. It was not dirty but it‚Äôs clearly not well taken care of. I had a feeling that they just cook, prepare food and that‚Äôs it. They could use some renovation. What I did not like again was the fact that the availabe sauces had no labels. I did not know what I was putting on my dumplings. The bathroom had no dryer or toilet paper. The food is relatively cheap.; Sorina Emanuela Cristescu: Is a chineze restaurant. The food is ready in 10-15 minutes. Is good and fast. We eat beef Noodels and pea Noodels with vegetables ( this was spicy) , were good and also we taste some dumplings with cabbage ( this was not for out taste). I will go here to taste more thinks because this is really chineze place.; Mihai P: The establishment is not amazing, it's very simple and would need some refurbishing,  the customer service is beyond atrocious, about on par with other Romanian customer service. The wait is pretty long

So why did I give it 5 stars?
The food is amazing, cheap and in large quantities.  I've been to many Chinese restaurants in various countries, but this is the first real Chinese restaurant I've been to.

The food is delicious, portions are usually medium sized, atmosphere is nice and the serving is good.
I also had a table here with 20+ people, and the serving was impeccable.
I come here quite often, because, lile I already said, the food is good, decent priced, and the atmosphere is nice (even inside during winter time). You also have big TVs inside if you need to watch something.
Trully recommend the place.; Augustin Onaciu: Food is acceptable although size of portions and quality went down while prices went up
Service is really good, with polite, joyful staff
Atmosphere is nice, can be loud at certain times
Plenty of parking options near the location
Beautiful terrace, very green and lush; Mk Ten: Just had a quick breakfast here, and we had the frittata (omlete) and the ham and cheese sandwich. They didn‚Äôt have a vegetarian breakfast option and they do not sell anything else before 12:00. The food was decent to good, the sandwich does not have bread instead they use burger bun :) service was ok, the place itself is great!; Cristina Danuletiu: Delicious food and a great place overall!
Very nice location near the Central Park, and has cute lights at night.

The food is fresh and tastes good. 10/10
Prices a bit high, but the food is of great quality so  it‚Äôs worth it.; Alex Avram: We've been there four times so far and even though I was dragged there everytime as wanted to go some place else, we have had lovely experiences. The waiters were very friendly and polite, providing us the best recommendations. The atmosphere was idyllic and the food was very tasty. We didn't had wings or anything you can grab from a takeaway for that matter. We've tried the following so far: stakes, sea food, the absolutely amazingly tasty bone marrow, the roasted duck with red wine sauceü§§, the smoked beef brisket, the beef ribs and the risotto.
We weren't disappointed by any of them. In fact, after 7 months spent in Barcelona where I've had sea food everyday, I'll have to say their king prawns with tabbouleh salad were absolutely delicious.

They have a nice garden and the interior of the restaurant has a bit of a posh British pub energy. Definitely recommend! ü•∞",0.86
Livada - Cluj,"Strada Clinicilor 14, Cluj-Napoca",4.1,ChIJGeCqyIMOSUcRJBV-7x77fTc,"Ana S: One of the nicest restaurants in town, and one of the few with a little interior garden, secluding the place like an oasis in the city center, right between the old town and the central park.
Good food and good service (although I hear that the service may not be so good all the time, probably when the place is full of people).
We had the halloumi salad and the salmon, plus matcha latte and espresso tonic which was interestingly good. The salad was good, and the salmon a bit too sweet in terms of the combination.; Ioachim Lihor: Livada - Cluj Restaurant is a standout dining destination in Cluj-Napoca. Nestled in a scenic garden setting, it offers a relaxing atmosphere perfect for any meal. The menu highlights a fusion of traditional Romanian and contemporary dishes, prepared with fresh, local ingredients. Guests often commend the excellent service, beautifully presented food, and the serene outdoor seating area. An ideal spot for a memorable dining experience.; Ana Maria: We had dinner at Livada and the food was extraordinary. The dessert was also very good, not too sweet at all. We liked the service and the entire atmosphere. We also liked that the portions were reasonable and not too small.; Colda Andrei: I initially reviewed this for 5 stars around 6 years ago. A lot changed since then. I also ate here a few months ago and the food was decent, they had some amazing dumplings with different sauces in the same plate.
They changed the menu recently and switched that dumplings with the traditional ones but tasteless.
The food is now mediocre and pricy for the offer. Would not recommend anymore; Mariia Soliar: I chose Livada because of their great location: it‚Äôs not very centered and therefore not extremely crowded at least in the morning and it is very close to the central park where I wanted to walk afterwards.
I had breakfast at Livada and it was amazing. I ordered eggs Benedict (served on toasts with bacon and fresh salad) and a grapefruit fresh. The meal was delicious!
I also loved the atmosphere - it‚Äôs like a loft but a cozier version of it. There are guitars and vinyls on the walls, I was lucky to sit next to John Lennon‚Äôs vinyl üòÅ I guess there are evening music events at this place. Pity, I won‚Äôt have a chance to visit one this time but I‚Äôll definitely keep Livada in mind.
The staff was very calm but friendly and polite.

The prices were on the higher side, but the pork knuckle we ordered was great. However, I was quite disappointed by the very burnt pizza Diavola that was served to me. On a positive note, the service was great and the restaurant itself is very aesthetically pleasing. Overall, it was a bit of a mixed bag, but the good service and ambiance somewhat made up for the food shortcomings.; Marius Mucenicu: It's a nice restaurant, with a calm and relaxing atmosphere. Dinners in places like this work wonders.

Service was mediocre, unfortunately. We were told that without a reservation we'd have to eat fast or they won't seat us. Once we sat down they paid little to no attention to us, because larger groups were prioritized (it makes sense, since more people means a bigger check and potentially a bigger tip).

Food was okay, but the quality is nowhere near the prices which are on the high end. I mean, for that money you're dining at premium restaurants like Baracca or Adi Steakhouse.

I'll probably return but they definitely won't be my first choice.; Orsolya G√°l-Jank√≥: The location is nicely designed. The service was good.
On the front page of their menu it is not mentioned that their special menu offer is not available during weekend.
Tomato soup was reach in flavor, lasagne prepared  great, although a little under seasoned.

Taking all in consideration it is a good place to have your meal.; Cristina Aerpo: We loved the brunch had (Eggs Florentine and Scrambled eggs with mushrooms). The food was soooo delicious and the flavours were incredibly tasty ü§ç
The music and the overall atmosphere were perfect and the serving as well!

Definitely we'll be back when we will be in Cluj again! 10/10!; Constantin Boca: The place looks great but the atmosphere was ruined by loud an abnoctious club music, very inappropriate for a restaurant. I ordered spaghetti Bolognese which were great and a burger which was just basic.",0.9

I was there for lunch and had the house-special mozzarella chicken, which is oven baked chicken breast with tomato sauce and mozzarella. They serve it with a fresh salad on the side, I ordered some pizza bread, they are delicious, especially when fresh out of the oven.
Everything was tasty, I had a mulled wine afterwards, which also was good, a bit too sweet for my taste but good.
Definitely recommend the place, they have daily menus as well, a healthy selection of (especially) Italian food.; Jari: The recipes and everything are pretty much exactly as they have always been. But the pizza is just awesome, one of my favorites in Cluj.; Diandra Marinescu: This week when we visited, being December, they had a Christmas tree and Christmas carols playing. This was the thing I loved the most. The atmosphere was lovely. It's kind of pricy but the food it's tasty and good. I liked the fact that i could choose vegetal cheese for my pizza.

Always feels a bit strong to come out with such a statement, but the Veal Cutlet & Green peppercorn sauce main was just immensely delicious, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned - one of those rare moments were I could close my eyes and enjoy every mouthful.

The only draw back? The food took over an hour to arrive. However, the exceptional quality of the meal made it worth every minute of the wait. If you‚Äôre willing to be patient, you‚Äôll be rewarded with a truly memorable dining experience!!!; Robert Simoiu: We had a really nice experience here, in the outside garden, of course.
The menu is rich, you have a lot of options to choose from, including starters, main courses, desserts, amd beverages.
The key point here I think is the garden outside, but the food was also tasty. We had various starters, main courses and desserts, and overall it was delicious. A little pricy, but still reasonable.
I recommend this place.; Ioana Condor: I recently dined here with family and was really impressed. The food was exceptional, bursting with flavor and beautifully presented.
Moreover, the restaurant was impeccably clean, which added to the overall pleasant dining atmosphere. The staff was attentive and friendly.
Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a satisfying meal.; Fulep Sebastian: I do not recommend. I recently tried the Euphoria Burger, and I must say, it was quite a disappointment. The patty was overcooked and dry, lacking the juiciness one would expect from a premium burger. The bun was stale and fell apart easily, making it difficult to enjoy the meal. Additionally, the toppings were sparse and didn't add much flavor or texture to the burger. The overall presentation was unappealing, and the taste was far from euphoric. For the price, I expected a much better experience. I won't be ordering this burger again. Junk !; Lucas: Pretty oily chicken for a ""grill chicken"", but overall good.

Walking in, the space is beautifully-decorated and they even a small kids play area. I ordered takeout and within 15 minutes and 96 lei later, I was on my way.

I ordered their version of orange chicken. It's not at all like what I am used to in the U.S.A. (or even China), but it was tasty. The chicken breast is breaded and there are actual orange slices in it. It comes with rice.

For dessert, I got the black sesame dumplings. They came swimming in hot water. They are medium-sized balls filled with sugar and black sesame paste.; Mina Docinski: I went for a quick visit, I really like the arrangement of the place and the service was absolutely excellent.

I ordered a daily menu, and for 22 lei, which is less than 4 euros, I has a pork, bambus and mushroom soup and chicken Sishuan, the portions are really big, so maybe ask for less rice or just take one dish. As for the taste, they were not great but not bad either, out if 10, I would give a 7.

They checked my receipt and then started preparing the order... 45 MINUTES?? What the hell were they doing in that time?.. And we were one of many customers who seemed to either have their orders delayed or from what I can tell by the reaction of the others.. messed up.

Previously made orders via Glovo.. and I'd say that 1 in 3 orders made are either missing items entirely or somehow, the wrong size or amount of something.

I was extremely disappointed with my first and last order at Papabox Cluj.

The biggest shock was the pizza, so since I've been ordering food I haven't encountered anything like this: the pizza seems to be made from dough bought in the supermarket. Please, Papabox, correct me if I'm wrong. But the dough has a pricked pattern on the bottom, and the consistency is that of a dense sponge. We have also done it at home. As far as I know real pizza dough doesn't stiffen before being put in the oven and being very soft it wouldn't even keep those shapes.

I also ordered a schnitzel menu which turned out not to be actually schnitzel, but a pre-frozen preparation made of meat paste, not chicken breast... This was personally confirmed by them. So, I used to walk 1 minute to Kaufland and buy my ""snitel"" at 20% of the price they sell it for.

Please understand: when you order from a restaurant you expect cooked food. Not food; Mihai Toma: I ordered 3 times from them, twice I was missing products, plus the pizza came with the seal detached; Valentina Cira: A frozen pizza at a restaurant price... Raw crust... not even the ingredients on the pizza are fresh.

The food was good, one thing to mention is that I forgot to comment (in browser) how I want my steak, I wasn't asked and it came well done, which I didn't enjoy that much, but overall it was ok.
The desserts were also really good, mine was quite big.
All in all, a place worth visiting a second time.; adi coman: I totally recommend this new Vagabundos place!
Went for brunch with a couple of friends.
There is a barista that prepares your coffee and it's great! They have vegan options too.

Plenty of food that wants to be fancy, though for some reason they don't know how to properly cook potatoes.
They're either like a mushy glue or half cooked. I've told the staff of the not fully cooked potatoes (still crunchy) and they arrogantly brushed it off saying they are cooked ""according to our standards"".
The only reason why they're not yet out of business is the many office buildings nearby and the lack of other food places within walking distance.; S√°ndor Bokor: The food was good. They have daily offers, one with meat other vegetarian. Otherwise it is a bit expensive. The place itself is nice, huge windows, nice interior design.

The tempura rolls looked and tasted like they were made yesterday and had an uncharacteristic and frankly putrid smell, taste, and texture. The chicken roll was also inedible, the chicken was hard but rubbery at the same time (how do you even do that!?) and tasted like biting into a leather shoe.

I ordered through Bolt Food (maybe that contributed?) and am presently fighting for a refund after this sushi made me physically sick!

The hotel's behaviour will surely also affect bookings done for the Untold festival.

Edit: I'm confused over the reason my review was rejected, what policies did it fail to respect?

London Brothers Cluj,"Strada Observatorului 82-86, Cluj-Napoca",4.5,ChIJWQuzXbYNSUcRTUES1jYjlU0,"Bogdan: Pizza was good. Burger was average. They seem specialized in vegan/vegetarian options. Bun was too thick and could not really sense any flavours. Food also arrived a bit late and cold. Will probably try again.; Agi22: At first (2-3 years ago) the food was amazing but now it's average at best. Everything is soggy, dry and has no taste. Last time we ordered a vegan chicken wrap and it came literally in pieces. The filling fell everywhere. Very disappointing.; Kat: Thought that this was a restaurant but turns out it‚Äôs take out only so decided just to order and take it home. Got the Waugh burger and fries. The wagyu burger was good at first but with time was a bit too overpowering on flavors and got extremely messy (like need to wash your hands multiple times messy). The portion size was too large in my opinion and added to the mess, I think it would be better smaller. The fries were good and the spices on them tasted great. The regular aioli was good, but the spicy aioli had almost no flavor and definitely no spice. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend the spicy aioli. Overall a bit expensive and wasn‚Äôt the best meat. I might come back to try a vegan burger as there‚Äôs a great selection and see how that goes.; Bea D: Best burgers, fries, bao buns and food in general. Really special and different experience compared with other places. I 100% recommend it. ‚ù§Ô∏è; B 5: The best part about this place is that anything you'll order from their menu will be the best food you've eaten that day! Their noodles are hands down the best noodles in town, not to mention the burgers. I would also recommend not to miss out on the deserts, they are amazing!

Vibe Fusion & Restaurant Sushi Cluj,"Strada Zorilor 25, Cluj-Napoca",5,ChIJfZEzwxsPSUcRYiqpDiR21qQ,"Robert Simoiu: We found this hidden gem which is not that far from our place, and we wanted to give it a try. The overwhelming positive reviews definitely had a big impact, along with the shared photos.
Even though this is not a sushi-only restaurant, I tried some sushi combo with rolls, maki, and nigiri, and I was really impressed. The meat was fresh, and tasted good. The others tried pasta with chicken, and that was also good.
We wrapped up with some elegant fine dining like desserts, along with some fruit tea.
To summarize, a really cozy experience on a cold evening.; Stefania Lucaci: If you're looking for a cozy and stylish dining experience, this Scandinavian-Boho themed restaurant is a hidden gem.
The menu features a variety of intriguing dishes. While the offerings may seem like typical breakfast fare at first glance, each one has a unique twist that turns every bite into a delightful surprise.
Coffee lovers will appreciate their expertly brewed coffee, rich and smooth.
To top it all off, the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive.; Ana Campos: Very nice, cozy place. The beef tenderloin I ordered was perfect; everything else was also done with a lot of love and care. You can see the dedication in the details. Nice background music and ambience. Prices are reasonable. Service was great, so all in all a great experience I can recommend further.; Vizi El≈ëd: Sushi was super delicious and everything was fresh and amazing.

The food offering is broad but, the cuisine is not stellar, it's decent, some dishes are better.
The music is just the random radio or TV boring and annoying hits.
The service is also not too sharp, they sometimes make mistakes or miss your order altogether.
I'm rating 4 stars mostly because of the price, I'm considering it to be a decent neighborhood restaurant. You can smoke in one partially open room. It's not my thing but I though why not mention it.
The food can be dry at times, but it's still better than some other options.; Marius Cristian Nistor: Very friendly staff, good food, very good prices but people smoke inside; Maria R: Low prices. Great food.

Great also for large groups.; Mihai Rotaru: Fine for a fast dinning. Its middle place on TripAdvisor among restaurants in Cluj-Napoca it is well deserved.

If you happen to stay here when one of those is happening, there isn't a quiet moment all day, because the bass from the music coming from nearby is just deafening. It might be from the bar across the street or events organized right in the hotel parking lot, which makes it impossible to find a parking spot too.

I ordered baby ribs, unfortunately the waitress explained to me, not available.
She recommended something else, being more acceptable.
Overall, great lunch.; Marius Mucenicu: While their pizzas remain a reliable choice, other menu items have lost their appeal, and I wouldn't recommend them. Stick to pizzas for a decent meal.

The dining experience is passable, but improvements are needed, particularly with the furniture arrangement. Booths with couches suffer from tables placed a bit too far from the couches, affecting comfort. Additionally, the prices seem a bit steep for what's offered.

Also, I'd recommend dining in over ordering for a better experience. Unfortunately, once the pizzas get cold during delivery, they lose their taste. Enjoying them fresh in the restaurant makes the experience more worthwhile and rewarding.; Ray Rei: Food was DELICIOUS. Had good time w my friends, servers were also having fun. Best atmosphere ate everything Ngh; Horatiu Popescu: Good Experience. Pizza's just like in any other Pizza Hut, so nothing special there, but the service is excellent, especially since at dinner time this is an overcrowded restaurant. Place is nice and tidy. Toilets could be a tad cleaner. Parking can be found at the mall, whilst the lake view is quite a nice one. Recommendable experience overall.; Gabuza: My first time at a location lite this. I had a margarita pizza with some extra toppings. Compare to the price and taste, it is good.

The food arrived cold, which really took away from the overall taste and quality. There is nothing more off-putting than expecting a warm, fresh meal only to receive something that feels like it‚Äôs been sitting out for too long. Beyond just being cold, the flavors were bland and unappealing, making it hard to enjoy any aspect of the meal.

For the high prices they charge, I expected much better quality. Unfortunately, what I got was nowhere near worth the cost. It felt like I was overpaying for something that didn‚Äôt even meet the basic standards of flavor or freshness. The ingredients didn‚Äôt seem fresh, and the overall presentation of the dishes was poor.

It‚Äôs frustrating to spend money on food that doesn‚Äôt meet even the simplest expectations, especially when there are many other options available at more reasonable prices and better quality. Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place if you‚Äôre looking for a satisfying meal.; Dorina Abrudan: Great food! Lots of options for the whole family. And when your teenager said that is much better than he expected that means that the chicken King Wrap is delicious!!
The Omega 3 salad with the orange fresh was great, but the Dakota salad was exqusit. Did I expect to be asked how I want my beef geilled in a fast food? No, but the feeling was great and so was the meat! I think next time i will take the croutons on the side though!
Salad Box - thumbs up!; Patrick Werz: I decided to go with the make your own option, 5 + falafel. Unfortunately the lettuce itself counts as ingredient, but otherwise it was a very good salad. If you go for the make your own you have plenty of options to eat vegetarian or even vegan.; Sorina: They used to have much more variety of vegetables, but now there are many products, no related to salad. There used to be spinach, ruccola, and now there is only lettuce from herbs. What a pity, I used to eat there every one or two week, now I only see it and feel sorry I can‚Äôt have a good salad any more.; Dan Haiduc: Long wait. Hot dressing is not hot at all, just very oily.

I like to eat here the gyros, and souvlaki is really great, I think the best in Iulius mall.; summerinthedeephouse: These people have no clue of how and what a GYRO or Souvlaki is and tastes like. Tried it Botosani- it was terrible. Asked if they have ever tried a real Greek Gyro and one of the staff answered "" to be honest I dont even know how they taste in Greece..."" Then I gave it another chance in Cluj. It was terrible, went to trash. Whoever knows the real Greek taste, should never eat at this restaurant. Waste of money, expectations and time.

Anyways, a very good option for a good meal these days.; LondonNight: Got barely some food, and it wasn't much, and paid a lot on it, disproportionately high cost for the amount of food. 26 lei for some little bit of pasta?

Too bad.; matumba: They ignored every single thing I wrote on my note. I SPECIFICALLY said two tacos NO SALADS. AND YET THEY MANAGED TO CRAM AS MUCH SALAD AS THEY COULD. Also my order was delayed for 20 minutes. Read your notes next time.; Iceberg: The tacos are supposed to be crunchy and more spicy. I ordered a taco with crispy, and I got a cold tortilla with one single crispy in it. The spicyness is similar to a pinch of paprika powder. It's nearly nothing like a taco.

The raw oyster on ice was very fresh and tasty, very well presented and prepared on the spot, high quality product at high end restaurant level (fresh taste, thoroughly cleaned shells, no shell fragments after being cleaned, only thing that did not make you feel you re in a high end restaurant was the fact that you were serving it in a mall and the lack of the usual utensils). For main I chose the grilled perch which was just being prepared on the grill, with sides basmati and wild rice.

To an adult that's like a popcorn kernel, for real. And you get a ton of fries so I mean if you're up for fries and something on the side and not the other way around I guess this is for you.

The servers went to serve next customers before finishing with us, they didn't wear gloves and grabbed food with their hands, they repeatedly ignored our questions or requests, and laughed at us and complained about us to each other.
If you would like to experience a soviet style service, you should come to this restaurant.

We didn‚Äôt wait to long for the food itself but it was still cold.

It sits on top of the mall, in an area which was previously used as a parking space. You're welcomed by a modern, minimalist design, with tables sitting at a comfortable distance from each other, which means that even if the place is packed you'll still feel comfortable. Some of the food items come from the kitchen downstairs, from the other Marty restaurant, which is situated at the ground floor. The food itself is alright. Rarely I was disappointed with what I was served, and I have tried a lot of time items from the menu ranging from tomahawk steak to bbq ribs to pizzas and pastas and burgers, etc. So yeah, there's an abundance of items in the menu, so you're not lacking variety. The staff is friendly and the prices are a bit high, but I guess they only reflect the current economical and political situation (pandemic, outbreak of war, shortages of supplies, inflation etc).; M.H: 23.06.2023, 21:30
To have sits at a table in the Marty sky garden restaurant, wasn't allowed. Why? Because the last order was already processed. This was the answer. Seriously?!?

First review

This place serves one of the most delicious burgers in Cluj Napoca.

Highly recommend if you want to eat something made with passion

Beautiful place with an outdoor terras!; cristina cris: Had a cheeseburger. Service was fast however burger was not as tasty as they say it is. You can tell the meat inside is of good quality but overall mix was pour in flavours. Definitely not worth 45 Ron. Will not have it again.; Roxana Butnar: The food was low quality, although the prices were not low at all.
We requested the meat in the burger well done and it was not respected. We also ordered two types of fries (sweet and normal potato) both were undercooked and almost raw in the middle.

The grilled cheese with chicken was ok.; Bocancea Octav: Very tasty and good price. The meat was well-cooked, the sauces are in moderate quantity and the vegetables are fresh. I strongly recommend you to give it a try!",2.6

I am so happy there are so many vegan options üòç
Amazing texture combo soft stretchy.. The ice-cream inside is very interesting more like thick cream but I enjoyed every single bite. The one star less is because it is quite expensive in today's  economy and I wish to buy more but can't afford. If it would be 10 lei one big mochi instead of 14 would make a significant difference.; Laura Sabau: Best mochi in Cluj so far. They are a bit pricey (12-14 RON), individually wrapped and refrigerated. However, there are 15+ flavours to choose from. Highly recommend.; Denisa Paraschiv: Their desserts are good. I don't have
Nothing to complain about except for the price, which I promise does not seem justified to me.
My problem is with the management staff:)) stupid people, full of themselves and with no other values ‚Äã‚Äãapart from material ones. Good luck with Victoria, who was like a breath of fresh air and I'm glad I was able to meet her.
I gave them the brand presentation for Kombucha in Romanian in the hope of a thank you and recognition of the merits in some way, even the kiss me 5 meters behind didn't manage to say (and I'm speaking in the singular so that maybe someone feels the need) :)) they threw 50 lei and goodbye. I was thinking that, coming from the Republic, you are more with your head on your shoulders, more aware of the people and experiences you have here. Sin.

But everyone gets what they want, I'm sure they're doing just as well as when I decided not to collaborate with them anymore.; Anca: Expensive and bad taste. I tried 4 mochis with different flavors. They cost 52 lei. They are made in the Republic of Moldova and have nothing in common with Japanese desserts. The ice cream inside looks fake and tastes like cheap margarine. The aromas of mango, passion fruit, green tea and coconut are light, barely noticeable and not tasty. The rice that covers the ice cream should be elastic and soft, but the one here crumbles and has a strange texture, different from the authentic mochi. I do not recommend at all. A waste of money.

*Later edit: I mention that I waited 10 minutes for the mochis to thaw.",2.6

Nice place to chill out with friends or have a date); I S: We‚Äôve ordered 2 cocktails which have been quite pricy (besides being on the bar‚Äôs Special‚Äôs list) but the outcome was having two below average drinks. First of all I‚Äôve been told by the barmaid that she works there just for the weekend to earn some extra cash. Nothing to blame but this means she is not specialized in bartending hence just mixing of a list on the bar. When it came to ingredients, they used lower quality ones than what the actual displayed list said, actually some of them even missing. When I mentioned that they are not using the drinks on the cocktail list, again I‚Äôve been told they have seen worse days than this. Finally there was no manager in sight to discuss this situation with.

In conclusion just go there if you‚Äôd like something bottled, don‚Äôt bother trying their cocktails list. Overall just an overpriced place eager for money, not that much for quality.; Anthony Sewell: I have been going here alone regularly for a year. During 1 year in Romania I have been coming to this bar alone often. I was not even in the bar, and for some reason a crazy Romanian attacked me and said that he will break my legs if I return to this bar. I was walking to the toilet. So he will break my legs if I go to the toilet. I am sad about Romanian people a lot.

Also, there's little to no privacy as the tables are placed close to one another, and the room is not designed to reduce sound so everything is bounced off the walls and is loud, so you're hearing what everyone is talking about, and the same holds true in reverse.; Frank Mulder: I liked their specialty ‚ÄúPizza Seba‚Äù (with salmon and rucola).

Pasta with mozzarella di bufala DOP
42lei/8euro
It was a 9/10 for me
Absolutely delicious, but the only downside for my taste was the mozzarella do bufala DOP as it was a bit chewy. Other than that it was Devine and the tomato sauce seemed to be home made!

I can‚Äôt even fully describe how good they are. The fish (salmon, tuna, or shrimp) is always fresh and of great quality. We‚Äôve ordered the supreme plate twice along with another smaller sushi combination‚Äîonce the one with mango and another one I can‚Äôt quite remember, I believe it was golden 'something' plate‚Äîand both times, everything was fantastic.

All in all, I recommend the place.; Emanuel F.: Great experience with awesome people, went on Saturday and it was a day time party with grilling, I had the biggest burger they got, unfortunately didn't take a pic because I was fameshed.
As a smash burger, they know their stuff.

A good place to spend some quality time during a weekend afternoon.
